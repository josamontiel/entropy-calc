Certainly, I've added a section to emphasize the importance of deploying passwords that are not in leaked password databases in the README:

# Password Entropy and Password Security

## Introduction

Passwords are a fundamental aspect of digital security, serving as the first line of defense against unauthorized access to our online accounts, devices, and sensitive information. Password entropy is a crucial concept in password security. It measures the strength and unpredictability of a password, helping users and organizations create robust and resilient passwords. However, it's essential to recognize that while password entropy is a valuable metric, it should not be the sole factor considered when creating secure passwords.

## Password Entropy: What Is It?

Password entropy is a mathematical measure of the randomness and unpredictability of a password. It quantifies how difficult it would be for an attacker to guess or crack a password through brute force or dictionary attacks. The higher the entropy, the stronger the password.

### Factors Contributing to Password Entropy:

1. **Password Length:** Longer passwords generally have higher entropy because they offer more possible combinations.

2. **Character Set:** Including a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters increases entropy.

3. **Unpredictability:** Avoiding common words, phrases, or patterns enhances entropy.

4. **Unique Characters:** Using a wide variety of characters instead of repetitive sequences improves entropy.

## The Importance of Password Entropy

- **Security:** Password entropy directly correlates with the security of your accounts. Stronger passwords are more resistant to password cracking attempts.

- **Compliance:** Many security standards and best practices recommend or require using high-entropy passwords to protect sensitive data.

- **User Protection:** Educating users about password entropy helps them understand the importance of creating strong passwords and reduces the risk of account compromise.

## Beyond Password Entropy

While password entropy is a critical factor in password security, it should not be the sole focus when creating or assessing password strength. Here's why:

### 1. Human Usability

- **Memorability:** Extremely high-entropy passwords can be challenging to remember, leading users to write them down or choose less secure alternatives.

- **User Experience:** Complex passwords may hinder the user experience, leading to frustration and support requests.

### 2. Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

- **MFA Adds Security:** Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) significantly enhances security, even if passwords have lower entropy.

- **Password Backup:** Passwords become less critical when coupled with other authentication factors like biometrics or security keys.

### 3. Password Managers

- **Encouraging Best Practices:** Password managers generate and store complex, high-entropy passwords for users, eliminating the need for users to remember them.

- **Reducing Human Error:** Password managers reduce the risk of password-related errors.

### 4. Avoiding Leaked Password Databases

- **Leaked Passwords:** Deploying passwords that are not present in leaked password databases is critical. Attackers often use known passwords from previous breaches to gain unauthorized access.

## Conclusion

Password entropy is a vital concept in password security, and creating strong, high-entropy passwords is essential for protecting your online accounts. However, it's equally important to balance security with usability and consider other factors like multifactor authentication, password managers, and avoiding leaked password databases. Striking this balance is key to achieving robust and practical password security.

Remember that a comprehensive approach to security involves not only strong passwords but also proactive monitoring, regular password changes, and user education. Stay informed about emerging threats and security best practices to keep your digital world safe.
